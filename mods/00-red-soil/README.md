Replaces game textures for block soil with red tinted soil.

## Information

Mod Type: Theme 

**Asset Types**

- Textures: can be used by Theme mods to change game textures

Theme Packs are mods that do not change the game mechanics, only visuals, sounds, etc. They are packed like any other mod, using the type "theme".
Due to the way they work, theme packs never add new content, only replace existing content.

## Tutorial

This mod is part of 'VS Mods for Noobs', a guide to learning how to mod for VS from scratch

This example demonstrates:

1. Basic mod structure
2. Overriding theme game files (simple textures)

### Tips & Tricks

Note that although the original files are located in the game's "assets\survival" directory, when overriding them in a mod we use the "assets\game" directory path
