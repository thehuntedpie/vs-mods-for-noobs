# More Flint Arrowheads

Change Knapping recipes to better reflect actual item and object shapes

Note: This mod overwrites vanilla game item knapping recipes!

## Information

Mod Type: Content 

**Asset Types**

- Recipes: can be used by Content mods to override existing or introduce new recipes

## Tutorial

This tutorial is part of 'VS Mods for Noobs', a guide to learning how to mod for VS from scratch

This example demonstrates:

1. Basic mod structure
2. Overriding game recipes (json)

Note that although the original files are located in the game's "assets\survival" directory, when overriding them in a mod we use the "assets\game" directory path
